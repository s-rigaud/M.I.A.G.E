## Checklist

[x] Une API REST (REST-like mais la seule [bonne API gratuite de cocktail](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/))

[x] Projet VueJS qui se lance sans soucis d'installation

[x] Un menu et au moins 4 pages

[x] Une application responsive et sur desktop, tablette, paysage et portrait

[x] Lâ€™application doit utiliser au moins deux plugins Capacitor (LocalNotifications & Motion)

LocalNotification plugin is used to send notifications to the user when a cocktail is added or removed from the favourites cocktails' list. A notification is also scheduled at 4:30 pm every day to notify the user that it's aperitif time.

Motion plugin is used to add a cocktail to the list of favourites. To do so you need to go on a cocktail detail page and shake you phone. For now it only works on the first cocktail detail page opened in use. To be able to add another cocktail to the list by shaking you phone, you need to close the application, reopen it and click on a new cocktail to shake.

Group of 3 composed of Elyne Merlaud, Samuel Rigaud and Lucas Douillard
